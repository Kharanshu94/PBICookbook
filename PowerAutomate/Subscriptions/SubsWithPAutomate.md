## Limitations of native email subscription 
When you have paginated report on a premium/embedded capacity, you can set up email subscriptions for yourself and other users in your organization. When you set up email subscription, Power BI will send an email with the report as an attachment with a frequency of your choice. You can choose to have the attachment in different format, including Excel, PPT, PDF etc, up to 25MB.
However, currently subscriptions sent to all recipients are with the same attachments, this is because  report attachment reflects the data based on your permissions, and not the recipients'.
This blog covers an alternative approach using power automate, in which you are able to send different attachments to recipients based on their roles set up in Power BI dataset's security model.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
