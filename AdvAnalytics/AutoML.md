6. Give your dataflow a name, in this case "OnlineShopperIntention" and click **Save**


7. Click second icon "apply ml model" under actions and click on "Add a machine learning model"

11. Type in Model name, in this case "ShopperIntentionModel", Choose a proper amount of time for model to train, taking into account the lab durations, we will do "21 minutes", in reality, you want to give it sufficient time to go through all the algorithms and hyperprarameters and click **Save and Train**

12. The training will kick off, and you will see two additional tables for training data and testing data generated by the model training process. Click on the **Machine Learning Models** tab, you will be able to see the status of the model. Once the model training process is finish, the status will be updated to **Trained**.

14. Within the training report, you get three tabs, for "Model Performance", you are able to choose the probability Threshold to achive an balance ebtween precision and recall. Click on "see top predictors" button, to see the feature importance. The tab "Accuracy Report" explains model performance metrics, and the "Training Details" outlines details on training details, such as how many iterations were run, what model was chosen and what hyperparameters were usad

15. Click **Apply Model** on top right, choose the table you want to apply the model to, choose your threshold and click **save and apply**, you will see two "Query enriched" tables being created in the dataflow.

16. For this binary prediction model, it adds 4 output columns to the enriched output table: Outcome, PredictionScore, PredictionExplanation, and ExplanationIndex.
